​🌌 8D HYPER-PROJECTION // NEURAL-LINK V2.0
​A high-performance, browser-based simulation that projects an 8th-dimensional point cloud into 3D space. Built with Three.js, this simulation utilizes complex linear algebra to rotate data across higher-dimensional planes, modulated by hidden-axis depth squashing and neural-pulse color variations.
